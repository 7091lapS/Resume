# **Antonio Voce**

Junior web developer with a strong interest in the arts, technology and international affairs, I spent most of my twenties studying and working on both ends of the world.

Curiosity and a need to perpetually learn new things led me to explore software development. I was blown away by the endless possiblities that code offers, and fell in love with the creative process.

At Makers Academy I started learning about the best practices in object oriented programming, web development and TDD. Now I am looking to kickstart a career as a developer in a stimulating environment with likeminded individuals, where I can keep learning and contribute to innovative ideas.

# **Skills**

####**Team Player**

- I successfully pitched the idea for one of the final projects at Makers Academy: [rand(Cast)](https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast), a mobile app built with Ionic that allows users to discover new podcast episodes based on their preferences and listen to them on the go.  
- Worked with Agile methodologies to ensure all team members took part to all stages of the development of the app, with regular stand-up discussions and pairs swapping.
- Gained invaluable experience dealing with a multi-branched GitHub repo and merge conflicts, using collaborative tools like waffle.io to organize and assign tasks.
- Helped circumventing the difficulties we encountered in making API calls with OmniAuth authentication (a new and unexplored topic at the time) by helping build [our own API](https://github.com/ShuflCast/podcast_api_sinatra) using the [Audiosear.ch SDK](https://github.com/popuparchive/audiosearch-client-ruby). 


####**Languages and Web Frameworks**

I have worked on projects in **ruby** and **javascript/jquery**, have become familiar with **html/css** and **Foundation**.

I have built projects using the following frameworks:
- **Sinatra** - Helped me gain a good understainding of REST and CRUD principles. ([Here](https://github.com/7091lapS/chitter-challenge) is my go at building a twitter clone, and [this](https://github.com/ShuflCast/podcast_api_sinatra) is an API I built as part of our final project).
- **Ruby-on-Rails** - Became confident with MVC, model creation, ActiveRecord associations and migrations, Amazon Web Services file storage. ([My Instagram clone](https://github.com/7091lapS/instagram-challenge)).   
- **AngularJs** - Became familiar with directives, services and filters and learned the advantages of using a js framework in the construction of one-page applications.
- **Ionic** - Had to quickly learn the framework once we decided to build a mobile app ([rand(Cast)](https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast)) for our final project.

I have built my relational databases with **PostgreSQL** using **Datamapper** for my Sinatra projects and **ActiveRecord** for Rails.

**Test Driven Development:** I test drive my projects with **Rspec**, **Capybara**, **FactoryGirl**, **PhantomJS**, **Jasmine**, **Karma**, **Protractor**.

**Agile Methodologies:** I have learnt to extrapolate user stories from customers' requests, pair programming on most projects and collaborating in small groups, deploying regularly with the aim of delivering an MVP quickly. I am very comfortable with **version control** software and git flow.


I am fascinated with **data visualization** and have been teaching myself **D3.js**
