# **Antonio Voce**

Junior web developer with a strong interest in the arts, technology and international affairs, I spent most of my twenties studying and working on both ends of the world.

Curiosity and a need to perpetually learn new things led me to explore software development. I was blown away by the endless possiblities that code offers, and fell in love with the creative process.

I have learnt the best practices in object oriented programming, web development and TDD at Makers Academy, and I'm now looking to kickstart a career as a developer in a stimulating environment with likeminded individuals, where I can keep learning and contribute to innovative ideas.

# **Skills**

I have built projects using primarily the following **web frameworks**:
- **Ruby-on-Rails** blablabla link to instagram
- **Sinatra** blabla link to randcast api
- **AngularJs** blabla maybe link to beer stalker
- **Ionic** blabla link to rand(Cast)

I have acquired skills in **ruby**, **javascript/jquery**, **html/css**.

**BDD/TDD** I test drive my projects with **Rspec**, **Capybara**, **FactoryGirl**, **PhantomJS**, **Jasmine**, **Karma**, **Protractor**.

I have been using relational databases like **PostgreSQL**


**Agile Methodologies:** I have learnt to extrapolate user stories from customers' requests, pair programming on most projects and collaborate in small groups to create and deliver mvps efficiently. I am very comfortable with **versioncontrol** software and the use of collaborative tools like waffle.io.
